Identification and Classification of Brain Tumor

Abstract: A brain tumor is a medical condition characterized by the abnormal growth of cells within the brain. This study delves into the two primary categories of brain tumors: non-cancerous (benign) and cancerous (malignant). Predicting the survival rate of patients with brain tumors poses a challenge due to their rarity and diverse nature. Treatment approaches vary based on factors such as tumor type, cell abnormality, and location within the brain.

The field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning models, has brought about a paradigm shift in brain tumor diagnosis, utilizing techniques like the analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. This project specifically focuses on the detection of brain tumors from MRI scans, employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification technique. In cases where the detected tumor is non-cancerous (benign), the model further classifies the specific type of tumor.

The implementation of this model is conducted in the Python and TensorFlow environment. The research incorporates various algorithms and methodologies tailored to address specific challenges, with an emphasis on highlighting their strengths and limitations. The study explores quantitative characteristics such as shape, texture, and signal intensity of brain tumors, striving for high accuracy with a minimal error rate.
