Project Name: Identification and Classification of Brain Tumor

Abstract: A brain tumor is a disease caused due to the growth of abnormal cells in the brain. There are two main categories of brain tumors, they are non-cancerous (benign) brain tumors and cancerous(malignant) brain tumors. The survival rate of a tumor-prone patient is difficult to predict because brain tumor is uncommon and are of different types. Treatment for brain tumors depends on various factors like the type of tumor, how abnormal the cells are where it is in the brain etc. With the growth of Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning models are used to diagnose brain tumors by taking the images of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This project detects whether the brain tumor is present or not from MRI scans. It uses the CNN classification technique to classify the type of brain tumor present. If the detected tumor is non-cancerous(benign), further classification of the type of tumor is done. The suggested model is implemented in the Python and TensorFlow environment. Algorithms and methodologies used to solve specific research problems are included in the results along with their strengths and limitations. This examines the quantitative characteristics of brain tumors, such as shape, texture, and signal intensity, to predict high accuracy with a low error rate.
