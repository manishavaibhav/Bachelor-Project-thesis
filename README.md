Identification and Classification of Brain Tumor 

Abstract :
A brain tumor is a medical condition caused by the abnormal growth of cells within the brain. There are two primary categories of brain tumors: non-cancerous (benign) and cancerous (malignant). Predicting the survival rate of a patient with a brain tumor is challenging due to the rarity and diversity of these tumors. Treatment approaches vary based on factors such as tumor type, cell abnormality, and location within the brain.

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning models, have revolutionized brain tumor diagnosis using techniques like analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. This project focuses on detecting the presence of a brain tumor from MRI scans, employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification technique. In cases where the detected tumor is non-cancerous (benign), the model further classifies the type of tumor.

The implementation of this model is carried out in the Python and TensorFlow environment. The research incorporates various algorithms and methodologies to address specific challenges, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The study explores quantitative characteristics such as shape, texture, and signal intensity of brain tumors, aiming for high accuracy with a low error rate.
